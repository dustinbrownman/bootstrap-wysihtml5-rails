# Bootstrap Wysihtml5 for Rails

This is a forked version of the [Wysihtml5 for Rails gem](https://github.com/Nerian/bootstrap-wysihtml5-rails).
I forked this to make a couple of the icons work with Font Awesome rather than Glyphicons. It's a
total hack, but I just couldn't get the Glyphicons to work with my setup. May come back to this
later and make it work fully with font-awesome-rails, but we'll see.
